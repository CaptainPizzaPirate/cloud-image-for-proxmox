## How to Submit Changes

To contribute to this project, follow these detailed steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository
Click on the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page. This creates a copy of the codebase under your GitHub profile, allowing you to experiment and make changes without affecting the original project.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
On your local machine, clone the forked repository to work with the files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

### 3. Create a New Branch
Create a branch for your changes. This helps isolate new development work and makes the merging process straightforward:
```bash
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

### 4. Make Your Changes
Update existing files or add new features to the repository. Keep your changes as focused as possible. This not only makes the review process easier but also increases the chance of your pull request being accepted.

#### Follow Our Coding Standards
Ensure all code adheres to the standards outlined in our [Style Guide](STYLEGUIDE.md). This includes using proper naming conventions, commenting your code where necessary, and following the architectural layout of the project.

### 5. Test Thoroughly
Before submitting your changes, thoroughly test any new features or fixes. Our project strives for high-quality and reliable software, and your contributions should reflect this aim.

### 6. Update Documentation
If your changes involve user-facing features or configurations, update the relevant documentation files with clear, concise, and comprehensive details. This is crucial for ensuring all users can successfully utilize new features.

### 7. Commit Your Changes
Use clear and meaningful commit messages. This helps the review process and future maintenance:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a concise commit title and a detailed description of what was changed and why"
```

### 8. Push to Your Fork
Push your branch and changes to your GitHub fork:
```bash
git push origin your-new-branch-name
```

### 9. Submit a Pull Request
Go to your fork on GitHub, click on the ‘New pull request’ button, and select your branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any other relevant information to reviewers.

## Pull Request Review Process

All pull requests undergo a review process where maintainers look at the ease of integration, completeness of contributions, and adherence to the project’s standards. We aim to review contributions within one week of submission.
